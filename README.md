# Medical Pill Dispenser

This project focuses on an **automated pill dispenser** aimed at improving medication management and enhancing patient outcomes. The solution is designed to simplify the process of dispensing medication while ensuring compliance with prescribed regimens.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Develop an automated pill dispenser prototype for efficient medication management.
- **Research**: In-depth investigation into automated pill dispensers and their impact on patient outcomes.
- **Implementation**: Designed and developed a working prototype using microcontroller programming.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Dispensing**: Pills are dispensed based on programmed schedules.
2. **Doctor Interface**: Allows doctors to input and manage prescriptions remotely.
3. **User-Friendly Application**: A simple interface for patients to track their medication schedules and reminders.

## Application Prototypes

- **User Application**: https://www.figma.com/design/z4dWEVzJIeqjVPNnmXDglB/Pill?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=6MfsUzdy6swcKYLT-0
- **Doctor Interfaces**: https://www.figma.com/design/gS1wwpGBHGo3xsczJUxuFj/DOC-interface?t=6MfsUzdy6swcKYLT-0

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller Programming**: For implementing the hardware logic and dispensing mechanism.
- **Figma**: For designing user and doctor interfaces.
- **Hardware Components**: Microcontroller, sensors, and dispensing mechanisms.

## How It Works

1. **Input Prescription**: Doctors can input prescriptions via the doctor interface.
2. **Schedule Setup**: The dispenser processes the prescription and sets up a medication schedule.
3. **Dispensing**: Pills are automatically dispensed at the scheduled time.
4. **Alerts & Notifications**: Patients receive reminders and alerts for missed doses.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT for real-time monitoring and updates.
- Improved design for portability and scalability.
- Incorporating AI to optimize medication schedules based on patient history.
